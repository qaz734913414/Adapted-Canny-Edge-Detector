In this assignment, I successfully implement the required feature. The problem I met is following:
1. It is time consuming to figure out how to add new port/channel and bind them
2. We need a while loop inside each thread, because originally, the blurb/y is been called in a while loop
3. The range of row and col in blurx/y is tricky, it is easy to forget the boundary value.
