I successfully finished the required assignment. There are several problems that I have met and solved during the process.
1. generating 30 gray-scale image at once. 
2. how to use sprintf.
3. how to use GUI tool to calibrate the canny parameters. sigma controls the window size, thigh controls the number of pixels that passed the non maximal suppression, tlow controls the low pixels threshold
